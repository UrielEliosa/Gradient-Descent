Exercise: Gradient descent
Previously, we identified trends in winter temperatures by fitting a linear regression model to weather data. We'll repeat this process by focusing on the optimizer. Specifically, we'll work with batch gradient descent and explore how changing the learning rate can alter its behavior.

The model we'll be working with will be the same linear regression model that we've used in other units. The principles we learn, however, also apply to much more complex models.
